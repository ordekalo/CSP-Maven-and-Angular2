    The aim of this project is to create a website that manages trade of coupons. The coupon management system allow
    companies
    to create a coupons as part of their Advertising campaigns.<br> The main users of the system is companies that sales
    coupons, and private customers that buy the coupons. The third user of the system is 'ADMIN' (Administrator), which
    manage
    the system in the background<br> Each user have a variety of unique actions he can perform on the system.<br><br>
    This
    part of the project focuses on the system core, and the communications with the database, where the users, customers
    and
    companies, and their information are stored.<br> For example, the information on how many coupons every customer
    purchased,
    or what types of coupon each company created.<br> All this information is stored in a specific tables in the
    Database.<br>
    </br>
    The system core will be divided into 3 main parts:<br><br> 1. The creation of the database.<br><br> 2. Building a
    DAO (interface)/DBDAO
    (implement DAO) layers that allow to communicate with the database using SQL.<br><br> 3. Building Facade classes,
    that serves as
    user's interface which enables each user to perform the relevant actions according to the system's permissions
    (Administrator,
    Customers and Companies).<br><br> Each part includes several small steps, that which together present the core of
    the system
    (create java beans, building a connection pool, coupon system singleton as the main interface of the system, Daily
    threadï¿½)
    </br>
    <b>Data base:</b></br>
    The project uses the Apache Derby database. We created a local server on our local machine. All the information that
    runs
    in our system is stored in tables, which we created, in our database.
